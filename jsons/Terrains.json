	// Virtual River entry, used for stats, Uniques and Civilopedia
	// Modders take heed:
	// * This never exists on the map, it's a placeholder to allow you to mod the actual river's stats.
	// * The name is hardcoded to apply stats and the Stats Unique when a tile has one or more edges with an actual river.
	// * No other Unique is implemented and will work - for now.
